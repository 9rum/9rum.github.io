I am a research engineer at [MaumAI Brain](https://maum-ai.github.io/).
My research interests include in the duality of machine learning and computing systems, with a focus on systems for machine learning.

Before joining MaumAI, I received my M.S. in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from Sogang University, where I studied software systems for parallel training of neural networks.
